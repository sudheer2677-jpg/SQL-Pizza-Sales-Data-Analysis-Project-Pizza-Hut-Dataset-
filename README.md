🍕 SQL PizzaHut Sales Data Analysis Project
📘 Overview

This project analyzes PizzaHut sales data using MySQL to uncover valuable business insights and patterns related to sales performance, customer preferences, and product demand. The primary objective is to demonstrate how SQL can be used to perform data-driven business analysis, identify growth opportunities, and enhance reporting accuracy.

🎯 Objectives

Analyze total revenue generated by PizzaHut across different products and categories.

Identify top-selling pizzas and their contribution to total sales.

Determine most popular pizza sizes and order frequency patterns.

Examine category-wise sales trends and daily/weekly performance.

Generate cumulative revenue, percentage contributions, and ranking reports using advanced SQL.

🧱 Database Schema

The project consists of four relational tables that form a well-structured database model:

Table Name	Description
orders	Contains order-level details such as order_id, order_date, and order_time.
order_details	Stores quantity and pizza_id for each order.
pizzas	Contains pizza_id, size, price, and pizza_type_id.
pizza_types	Includes pizza name, category, and ingredients.

Relationships:

pizza_types (1) ───< pizzas (many)
pizzas (1) ───< order_details (many)
orders (1) ───< order_details (many)

🧠 Techniques & SQL Concepts Used

Data Cleaning and Transformation using SQL

Joins (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN) for merging multiple datasets

Aggregate Functions (SUM, AVG, COUNT) for key KPIs

GROUP BY, HAVING, and ORDER BY for segmented analysis

Subqueries & Derived Tables for nested calculations

Window Functions (RANK(), DENSE_RANK(), OVER()) for advanced analytics

Date and Time Functions for order trend analysis

📊 Key Insights

Analyzed 48K+ pizza sales records and identified performance patterns.
